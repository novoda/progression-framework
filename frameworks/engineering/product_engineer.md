### About our engineering progression frameworks
The engineering progression framework is a tool that helps engineers and managers:
- make development and career plans
- talk about what we‚Äôre looking for from engineers in a consistent way
- set a fair level of compensation.

The framework is a compass, not a GPS.

It's meant to be helpful. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases.

### How does it work?
~~The framework covers all the things we‚Äôre looking for from engineers at Novoda. We‚Äôre interested in these five elements:~~

~~- Mastery - Your Monzo knowledge and technical capability~~
~~- Impact - The size, scope and value of what you deliver~~
~~- Influence - How you change the world around you for the better~~
~~- Comms & Feedback - How you interact with others~~
~~- Leadership - How people around you become better and more impactful~~

~~We sort them into six levels, and we try to give specific examples of behaviours we expect for each. Each of those levels has a fairly wide salary range associated with it, and within each level you can progress in sub-levels, labelled A‚ÄìE. So even if you‚Äôre at level 3 for a couple of years, you‚Äôll still be able to see that you‚Äôre moving forward. Basically, the more behaviours you show from your level, the more you‚Äôll progress.~~

~~Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind closed doors. You‚Äôll agree what level of progression you‚Äôre going for and what you need to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you‚Äôre doing relative to that at all times.~~

### Things to keep in mind
~~- There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Monzo as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths in Monzo's engineering team.~~

~~- The framework represents a career‚Äôs worth of progression, people shouldn‚Äôt expect to fly up it in 18 months!~~

~~- Engineering progression isn‚Äôt an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.~~

~~- This isn‚Äôt a checklist ‚Äì it‚Äôs possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.~~

~~- There will be levels on top (eg ‚ÄòInventor of Android‚Äô or ‚ÄòAuthor of Go‚Äô), but we won‚Äôt add them until we need them.~~

~~- You can find some more information in these links. If that doesn't answer most of your questions, please ask your manager.~~

### Give us your feedback!
This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback.

We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.
